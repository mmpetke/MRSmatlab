% Correct for instrument phases to determine true phase of NMR signal:
% U = u*exp(1i*(-phases.phi_gen-phases.phi(isig)));
% 
% Called during stacking in MRSFit and MRSNoisereduction (stackrecordings) 
% 
% Currently, this correction yields the best estimate of the true signal 
% phase. But there is still an offset in phase which is most likely related
% to the amplifier phase phi_ampl. But it also seems to be related to the
% conductivity of the subsurface (see Skive 3), so the impedance? Unclear
% yet. See MRSmatlab documentation.
% 
% Input:
%   u      - voltage (complex, after QD)
%   phases - info from fielddata structure
%   isig   - which signal: 1 - noise, 2 - fid1, 3 - fid2, 4 - echo
% 
% Output:
%   U - phase corrected voltage
