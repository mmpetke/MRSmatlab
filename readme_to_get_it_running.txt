To get started (easiest way):

1. download and instal the "GUI Layout Toolbox" from MATLAB file exchange
	https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox
	This is a necessary toolbox for all the GUIs
	
2. start "MATLAB"

3. change the working directory of MATLAB to the locations of MRSmatlab. 

4. run "startMRSmatlab.m" in the command promt of MATLAB. This sets all pathes and you can start running the several GUIs.
